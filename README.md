**Develop Desktop HTML5 Tetris-like game called ‘Save the Animal’.** Tetris has appeared in many video game systems since 1984, so we expect you are familiar with the concept.

## Game Play
In our game, the goal is to drop animals down into a playing field. It’s pretty much how Tetris game works, but with animals.

**The animals of different kind would stack on each other in the playing field.**  
**When animals of the same kind touch each other, they clear out from the screen and player get points for that.**

### Controls
**The player should be able to move the animal right/left and rotate while it’s dropping down.** The speed of dropping down is on your own choice. **Player should be able to accelerate the dropping down speed if he/she wants to do so.**

### Features
**Player should be able to see the next 'animal' to fall down into the screen.**  
**There should be some kind of scoring system giving 10 points for every cleared pair of animals** (no need for the backend whatsoever. If game reloads, the score would start from 0).

**We have prepared giraffe, panda, chicken, fox, elephant, crocodile, and deer** and they are under **/assets** folder for you.  
**Assets are packed into one png file called 'asset.png' and there is 'asset.json' file.**

## Extra Features
**Develop HTML5 mobile version of the game**

### Requirements
**You can use any frameworks of your choice for making the game, but that should be HTML5 game.**

### Delivery
**Please, commit your project to your GitHub repo and let us know.**

Good Luck!
